throw the ymap into any stream folder or make a new one in this resource and put it in there
it holds a fileting table at flat iron lake as an example

the style.css you find in this extra folder makes for a smaller and transparent bobber, its not perfect yet but only an example
if you want to use it rename it to style.css and exchange with the one in html folder
